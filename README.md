# WBA Q2 Prerequisites

## Overview

These prerequisites are designed to assess ability to follow a structured process, execute tasks, debug simple errors, and ship code. It's important to understand each step of the process, as it forms the foundation upon which we build during week one of the cohort.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- **Basic Understanding**: This project assumes a basic understanding of software development concepts.
- **Ability to Follow Process**: Follow the outlined steps in this README to complete the project tasks.
- **Execution of Tasks**: Execute the tasks as described, ensuring completion of each step before proceeding.
- **Debugging Skills**: Debug simple errors that may arise during the project, using available resources and troubleshooting techniques.
- **Shipping Code**: Successfully push your code to GitHub, demonstrating your ability to deliver completed work.

## Note

These prerequisites are not intended to test your TypeScript or coding skills. Instead, they serve as a foundational process for building upon during the cohort. It's integral to comprehend the workflow and rationale behind each step rather than focusing solely on technical proficiency.
